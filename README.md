# organizepics

Tool for conveniently organizing a collection of image files into date-based subdirectories. Given a folder `images` with image files (IMG_20210202_123124.jpg,
VID_20210203_125125.mp4) inside, running `$ organizepics path/to/images` will produce the following output:

```
images/
  2021-02-02/
    IMG_20210202_123124.jpg
  2021-02-03/
    VID_20210203_125125.mp4
```
